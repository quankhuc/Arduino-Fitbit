# Arduino-Fitbit
Built a simple Fitbit using the Arduino that tracked step count and sleep duration. A near-real-time pedometer
detected, and recorded number of steps taken by the user. Sleep duration was detected and recorded by using an
accelerometer connected the Arduino. The two modes (sleeping and walking) were indicated by two LEDs connected
to the board. This information sets were sent from the Arduino to the local machine in a 1 Hz delta-time loop.
